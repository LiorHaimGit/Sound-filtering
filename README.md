# Sound-filtering
I'd like to introduce the concepts of FFT, low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters. Utilizing a sound sample seems the most intuitive method for demonstration, bearing in mind that the tools and conclusions remain applicable to any data.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Matlab or any other software capable of running *.m files installed on your machine.

### Running
```bash
run main.m
```

- All the necessary files are referred to from the main file.
- All the plotting files begin with 'plot_*.m' and can be adjusted to your needs.
